  coral: `# The Editor

Hermes is a writing tool that helps you think deeper — without doing the writing for you.

You're looking at a **rich markdown editor**. Everything you type is saved automatically. Try out a few things:

- **Bold** with \`Cmd+B\`, *italic* with \`Cmd+I\`
- Insert a [link](https://example.com) with \`Cmd+K\`
- Type \`# \` at the start of a line for a heading
- Use \`> \` for blockquotes, \`- \` for bullet lists

## Pages

See the colored tabs above? Each project has five pages — use them however you like. Separate chapters, different angles on the same idea, or notes alongside your draft.

Click a tab to switch. Your content is preserved across all of them.

## What makes this different

Most AI writing tools generate text for you. Hermes takes the opposite approach: it helps you develop *your own* ideas through structured thinking, honest feedback, and careful questions. The words are always yours.`,

  amber: `# The Assistant

The panel on the right is your AI writing assistant. It reads what you've written and responds with questions, suggestions, and observations — but it never writes *for* you.

## Highlights

When the assistant references a specific passage, it highlights that text directly in your editor. You can:

- **Hover** a highlight to see the comment
- **Accept** a suggested edit with one click
- **Dismiss** highlights you've addressed
- **Reply** to continue the conversation about that passage

## Philosophy

Hermes believes the act of writing is where thinking happens. If an AI writes your draft, you skip the part that matters most — the struggle to find what you actually mean.

Instead, the assistant helps you go deeper: challenging weak arguments, asking what you really intended, and surfacing connections you might have missed. It's a collaborator, not a ghostwriter.

*The assistant requires a free account. [Sign up](/signup) to try it.*`,

  sage: `# About Hermes

Hermes is built on a design philosophy called **Dignified Technology** — the idea that tools should protect and elevate the creative, expressive, and irreplaceable dimensions of human work.

Every AI product makes a choice: use the technology to *replace* the human in the process, or use it to help them go *deeper*. Hermes chooses depth. The writing is yours. The thinking is yours. The tool just helps you do both better.

You can read the full essay — [What Does a Tool Owe You?](https://dearhermes.com) — in the project switcher. It ships with every new account.

## Open source

Hermes is open source. You can read the code, suggest improvements, or fork it for your own use.
